# Asset Tracking Database  
## Mini Project
### C# .NET

This is a system for managing assets, where users can add assets such as laptops and mobile phones, and track these assets by their brand, model, purchase date, price, and associated office location.

**The system allows you to:**

- Add new assets (brand, model, purchase date, price, and associated office location)  
- Convert the price from USD to the local currency based on the office location  
- Display a list of all assets with converted currency in a table format  
- Change the console color depending on the date the product was added (from the `Asset` class and its subclasses: `Laptop`, `Mobile`)
